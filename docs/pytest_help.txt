# File: pytest_help.txt
# Purpose: Quick explanation of pytest fixture scopes, especially for Selenium driver fixture

- scope="function" (default):
  Runs setup and teardown for each test function separately.
  Ensures clean state per test, avoids side effects.

- scope="class":
  Runs once per test class, shared by all test methods in that class.
  Useful to speed up tests grouped in classes.

- scope="module":
  Runs once per Python file, shared by all tests in that file.
  Good for expensive setup reused across multiple tests.

- scope="session":
  Runs once per entire test session.
  For very expensive resources shared globally.

For Selenium, function scope is common to keep tests isolated.
