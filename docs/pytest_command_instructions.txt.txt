# File: pytest_help.txt
# Purpose: Quick reference for pytest run commands focusing on Selenium framework usage and reporting tools like pytest-html and Allure.

# Run tests with pytest-html report (lightweight HTML report)

pytest --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html

- Generates a single HTML report at reports/report.html.
- --self-contained-html bundles all resources inside the file (easy to share).
- You can specify test paths or markers, for example:

pytest tests/ --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html

# Run tests with Allure reporting (rich, customizable reports)

1. Run tests and generate results folder for Allure:

pytest --alluredir=reports/allure-results

2. Generate and serve the Allure report locally (requires Allure CLI installed):

allure serve reports/allure-results

- Or generate static report files to a directory:

allure generate reports/allure-results -o reports/allure-report --clean

- Then open the generated HTML report from reports/allure-report/index.html.

# Examples with other options

Run tests in headless mode and generate pytest-html report:

pytest --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html --headless

Run specific test file with pytest-html report:

pytest tests/test_login.py --html=reports/login_report.html --self-contained-html
