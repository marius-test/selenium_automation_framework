# selenium_automation_framework

Target website: [https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

This project implements a **scalable, maintainable Selenium automation framework** using **Python**, **Pytest**, and the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.

The goal is to automate and verify all major functionalities of the Saucedemo e-commerce site with clean test structure, detailed reporting, logging, and CI/CD integration. It provides hands-on experience developing advanced test framework features.

The framework is structured for **clarity**, **reusability**, and **modular growth**, allowing easy expansion as new features or test requirements are introduced.

ðŸ‘‰ For exploratory Selenium automation testing across a wide range of web functionalities, see my companion project: [selenium_automation_testing](https://github.com/marius-test/selenium_automation_testing)

### Framework Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)** for test scalability and maintainability  
- **Pytest** with fixtures for flexible test execution and setup/teardown  
- **Driver factory** for browser setup abstraction  
- **Custom logging** using `loguru` for enhanced debugging and traceability  
- **Allure reports** for rich test output and trend visualization  
- **Test configuration management** via CLI options or config files  
- **Headless/visible browser modes** and future multi-browser support  
- **CI/CD ready** using GitHub Actions and optional Docker containerization  
- **Screenshot on test failure** planned for better debugging

### Notes

This project is part of my ongoing QA automation journey. It reflects real-world framework practices like modular design, layered architecture, clear separation of concerns, and external integrations.

It's being built step-by-step, documenting and automating everything from the ground up, including virtual environment setup, logging, data handling, and reporting.
